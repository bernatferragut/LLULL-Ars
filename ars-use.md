## Mixture
This art uses three species of mixture for finding a logical medium, namely: the mixture of principles with one another, the mixture of principles with rules, and the mixture of rules with one another. And in this mixture, the species of the principles of the second figure are involved, and the species of the rules. And once a mixture has been made regarding some point, retain that option which truly appears to the intellect as the one most apt to be understood, loved and remembered: in this light,  the conclusions of this science become lucid and clear.# 5.

## Applying the art
Look well at the terms of the question or conclusion proposed to you, and if they are found explicitly in this art and in the mixtures, then judge according the explicit terms used with the general rules given here. But if the terms of the questions are implied in the explicit terms of the art, then reduce them to these explicit terms. Through these, similarly, all other arts are implied as everything, no matter what it is, can be reduced to these explicit terms.. 
For a practical method of applying the Art, see the treatise regarding rhetoric by Fr. Bernard de Lavinheta.

## The subjects
There are nine subjects that cover everything that exists, namely: GOD, Angel, Heaven, Man, Imagination, Senses, Vegetation, Elements, and Artificial instruments. And because of the diversity of these subjects, the principles of this art are diversified. In this way, through whatever is more like or unlike the subjects, conclusions can be drawn from the principles and rules. For in the same way as a crystal can take on various colorings, so can the principles be varied as they are juxtaposed to various subjects.
