And in this mixture, the species of the principles of the second figure are involved, and the species of the rules. And once a mixture has been made regarding some point, retain that option which truly appears to the intellect as the one most apt to be understood, loved and remembered: in this light,  the conclusions of this science become lucid and clear.# 5.

But if the terms of the questions are implied in the explicit terms of the art, then reduce them to these explicit terms. Through these, similarly, all other arts are implied as everything, no matter what it is, can be reduced to these explicit terms..
For a practical method of applying the Art, see the treatise regarding rhetoric by Fr. Bernard de Lavinheta.</p><h2 id="the-subjects"><a href="#the-subjects" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> The subjects</h2><p>There are nine subjects that cover everything that exists, namely: GOD, Angel, Heaven, Man, Imagination, Senses, Vegetation, Elements, and Artificial instruments. And because of the diversity of these subjects, the principles of this art are diversified. In this way, through whatever is more like or unlike the subjects, conclusions can be drawn from the principles and rules. For in the same way as a crystal can take on various colorings, so can the principles be varied as they are juxtaposed to various subjects.</p><h2 id="questions-on-the-subjects"><a href="#questions-on-the-subjects" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Questions on the subjects</h2><ol><li>Questions on Subject 1, or GOD</li><li>Questions on Subject 2, or Angels</li><li>Questions on Subject 3, or Heaven</li><li>Questions on Subject 4, or Man</li><li>Questions on Subject 5, or Imagination</li><li>Questions on Subject 6, or Sense</li><li>Questions on Subject 7, or vegetation</li><li>Questions on Subject 8, or the Elements</li><li>Questions on Subject 9, or Instruments</li></ol><h3 id="_1-questions-on-subject-1-or-god"><a href="#_1-questions-on-subject-1-or-god" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1.
