He is currently recognized as the author of Ars Magna, a combining logical system to discover the truth, conceived as an instrument to be used in interfaith dialogue to convert infidels. In the Ars Llull’s theological, metaphysical, and logical conceptions are amply illustrated, and they were developed throughout his more than 200 written works in Catalan, Arabic, and Latin. He is known for being among the first authors to use his vernacular language, Catalan, to communicate his thought.")]),e._m(2),i("p",[e._v("The Ars, or to be more precise, the development through numerous texts of a combining logical system to reveal the truth, is the most important and original product of Ramon Llull’s philosophy, and the main core of his work.")]),i("p",[e._v("Its development is divided into two great phases. The first one is called the Quaternary Phase, for it is organized based on the model of the four elements which form the base of the majority of the analogies used by Llull. The Quaternary Phase comprises two main texts: the Ars compendiosa inveniendi veritatem, written by Llull following the revelation of the Art at the Puig de Randa Mount in 1274, and the Ars demonstrativa in 1283, in addition to other texts that comment or explain the Ars. The second phase is known as Ternary Period, for it follows the structure of a trinity. It began with the criticism experienced in Paris with the Ars inventiva veritatis (1290), followed by the modification of the Tabula generalis (1293–4), and it concludes with the Ars generalis ultima (1305–8) and its abbreviated version, which incidentally had the most comments and discussions during the Renaissance, the Ars brevis of 1308.")]),i("p",[e._v("The Ars was conceived by Ramon Llull as an instrument to correct the mistakes of the infidels. In that way, it was to be a tool to aid the missionaries’ work. As a result, Llull did not structure this work based on the main Christian dogmas, the Trinity and the Incarnation, but on the common principles to the three religions of the book. As Rubio (2008a: 245) argues, “the secret of the Art consists of its demonstrating that the accepted world view implies the Christian view of God”. The most recent studies on the Ars (Ruiz Simón 1998; Rubio 2008a; Jaulent 2010) show that it addresses the criticism made by Llull to Scholastic logic. This criticism has two great stages: on the one hand, the insufficiency of the demonstration by syllogisms—the basis of all Scholastic science—to reveal new truths, because it only explicitly states the relationship between known facts and evident principles (Ruiz Simón 1998), thus relegating dialectics (or ars inveniendi), which consists of finding arguments and counterarguments based on some loci or “places”, to the domain of opinion. On the other hand, this criticism (Jaulent 2010) addresses the fact that demonstration by syllogisms only works through second intentions, that is, it describes relationships within logical propositions and not according to objects in reality, which are conceptualized as first intentions.")]),i("p",[e._v("Llull’s Ars would seek to form a logic system different to the scholastic one, through which novel truths that describe not only logical relationships, but also metaphysical relationships, can be discovered. According to Ruiz Simón (1998) and Bonner (2007), the Ars is defined by Llull based on four adjectives: compendioso and inventivo, like its first version; demostrativo, as in the second one; and general, in the final phase: (1) compendioso, for it is from some limited principles that an unlimited number of arguments can be found; (2) inventivo, because, through its combining mechanism, it makes it possible to find those arguments; (3) demostrativo, because it allows one to reach necessary conclusions; (4) and general, because it encompasses both real and logical objects, and it is thus applicable to any topic.")]),i("p",[e._v("Therefore, the Ars is a system to access any logical or metaphysical truth, a means to find novel arguments, an instrument to access all general and particular knowledge, and a tool for the missionary that seeks to refute the arguments of the infidels.")]),e._m(3),i("p",[e._v("The Ars is structured to answer questions, which are invariably found in the final sections of the different versions of the Ars.
