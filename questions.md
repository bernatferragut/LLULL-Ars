### How do I get started with  this system of memory training? 

Simply memorize the alphabet of nine letters, and the twenty eight principles and rules with their definitions. This is a self learning system, anyone applying it can get the results of increased power of memory, intelligence, will and imagination. 

### Where do I find the  28 principles and rules to memorize? 

This material can be found on the first page of Ars Infusa  (Art and Science of the Holy Spirit), which you can copy and paste into your word processor.  To help memorize the principles and rules more quickly, read and re read the text entitled "Configuring the Five Powers", as well as the "Book of the Natural Medium" And read the first six parts of Ars Generalis Ultima to see practical examples of the combinatory techniques, especially the Table and Evacuating Figure Three.

### How can I get a brief, complete overview of the system? 

Read through Ars Infusa, and view the mindmaps, which you can navigate by using the links, and your browser's "Back" button.

### After memorizing the 28 principles and rules, what is the next step? 

Practice combining the principles and rules by evacuating Figure Three, and by working with Figure Four and the Table. First answer the questions regarding GOD and the Angels in Ars Infusa, by referring to the sequences of cameras in the seven columns of the Table, and the other topics will become very easy to do.

### What are the other books on the site for? 

You are welcome to copy  the material on the site for off line reading. 
Note that the other books are all based on the same principles and rules and by reading them, you will easily see how the principles and rules are combined and applied, so as to apply them for yourself.

### How does the Art help me to acquire high speed learning capacity? 

The 28 principles and rules of the Art form a complete set of universal principles that can be applied to any subject. Everything that exists involves these principles and rules, namely:

"Goodness, greatness, duration, power, wisdom, will, virtue, truth, glory", 
"Difference, concordance, contrariety, beginning, middle, end, majority, equality, minority"; 
and can be investigated with the ten questions: 
"Whether, what, whose, why, how much, what kind, when, where, how, with what."

When you know these by heart, and as you develop the art of combining  them in the figures with the letters of the alphabet that stand for them, you can see that any new subject that you learn is understood much more quickly and easily, as you relate the new, unknown  material to these basic principles which are already known to you.

### In applying the Art to learning other subjects, do I have to go through all the principles one by one each time I learn a new item? 

Once you know the principles by heart, the ones which best apply to the topic at hand will become obvious, "in a flash" . As all the principles and rules hold together in a simple, coherent system built on necessary reasons, by touching upon one principle, all the others are implicitly or explicitly engaged. The analogy of the bell illustrates this: if you hit any part of a bell, the whole bell rings. For more difficult topics, you can go into the analysis of principles and rules in more detail.

### How does the Art help in speed reading? 

One of the secrets of speed reading, is to acquire the habit of keeping constantly in the back of your mind, a few questions such as "What"? "Why"? "How much"? "How"? etc. Practicing the Art will make this an automatic, effortless habit.
